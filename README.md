# NSS-Capstone-Streaming-Service-Comparison

## Short Description
Scrape data and create a dashboard to help users choose the best streaming service for them


## Executive Summary
This project will create an interactive dashboard to help people decide which streaming service is best for them and worth their money.  

The idea is for a user to be able to filter by factors such as genre, age group, and even specific shows and movies, and see which streaming service is best for them.  IMDB and rotten tomato ratings can be used to qualify “good” offerings are as well. 

## Motivation
During this COVID pandemic, streaming services have been one of my main forms of entertainment.  The area of streaming services has interested me for a while. It’s such a big example of disruptive innovation:  gone are the days when cable companies and their bundled offerings were the only way to watch tv.   

I have wondered and been asked before:  what is better…Netflix or Hulu?  Hopefully with this project, I can best answer that question for people (an answer that clearly depends on their preferences!)

## Data Question
Overall question is: what is the best streaming service for a certain person? This will vary person to person. Some factors that could be considered:
-	Favorite genre (action, horror, etc)
-	Age group 
-	Number of offerings by the service
-	Quality of offerings by the service
